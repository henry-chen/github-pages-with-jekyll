Gatsby themes encapsulate all of the configuration and implementation details of Gatsby websites. This is a starter-kit (boilerplate) with a dependancy on the gatsby-theme-carbon package. The primary goal of gatsby-theme-carbon is to get content authors speaking the IBM Design Language with Carbon as soon as possible. It includes some sample components/content demos in the src/pages directory.
